How many people make tweets in a day? How many tweets share common words? Where do most users make tweets from within the United States? In order to answer these questions, I have made two maps and two word clouds for two different days a week and a half apart from each other. I want to compare the difference in how many tweets are posted based on location, and the difference in how often words appear overall, over a time difference of a week and a half. The reason I want to observe this comparison is because generally, it doesn't feel like a lot happens in a week and a half, but with the COVID-19 situation and major events happening in the world nowadays, there could be a mass amount of tweets happening in just one day of a week compared to the week previous, and I think that would say a lot about the activeness of users on technology during these moments.

### Map
For this map, I can see that the majority of tweets that happened occurred on the east coast and west coast. Most of them seem to come from major cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Boston, etc. This would make sense because there is a large population of people living in those cities.

### Word Cloud
For this word cloud, I can see that the word "Go", "Up", and "Out" were the most tweeted words. This can explain how at the time of day these tweets were scraped, the weather might have been pretty nice since people were likely tweeting a lot about going out.

## 04/22/2022 Tweets

### Map
For this map, I can see the tweet location distribution is pretty similar to the one a week prior. However, it seems like there are more tweets in the major city clusters than there were before, which might be attributed to the fact that these tweets were happening on a Friday afternoon, which is when people usually get out of work and school for the weekend and are free to make tweets.

### Word Cloud
Relating to the map, the idea that people have just gotten out of work would make sense because according to the word cloud, the word "Job" is the most tweeted word for this day. Additionally, it could mean people who are job searching are all tweeting about it in the same day, which would add to the frequency of "Job" being used.
